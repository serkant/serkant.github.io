title: "Politics and Tree Cover Loss: Evidence from High-Resolution Satellite Data"

excerpt: '*R&R at New Perspectives on Turkey*


Environmental issues have gained saliency in Turkish politics over the last decade, especially after the Gezi Park demonstrations. However, no systemic empirical evidence exists to inform us about the relationship between politics and tree cover in Turkey. Although Turkey witnessed significant tree loss over the last decades, we do not know how much of this damage is attributed to politics. Using high-resolution satellite data, this paper provides the first empirical relationship between local politics and tree loss. The results show that districts with Justice and Development Party (AKP) mayors have higher tree loss by around a combined area of 62 football pitches on average. These results imply that local governments can have a substantial impact on the environment despite their limited effect in the design of environmental policies.
