excerpt: '*Accepted for publication at New Perspectives on Turkey*


During the last decade, environmental issues have gained saliency in Turkish politics, especially after the Gezi Park demonstrations. However, no systemic empirical evidence exists to inform us of the relationship between politics and deforestation in Turkey. This paper combines possible major drivers —political, economic, and climatic— of deforestation in Turkey with high-resolution satellite data on deforestation to conduct a systemic empirical analysis. The results show that districts with Justice and Development Party (AKP) mayors have higher deforestation — around a combined area of forty-two football pitches on average in a given district. Similarly, increased mining activities and newly built hydropower plants positively correlate with deforestation.
