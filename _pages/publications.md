<p style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; width: 75%;">
   This paper examines whether electoral accountability deters public officials from abusing the law, using a novel indicator of law abuse that measures the unjustified use of the unforeseen events clause: an exception clause common in procurement regulations that grants officials with more discretion at times of force majeure events. By exploiting a natural experiment and applying a staggered Differences-in-Differences (DiD) design, we find that public officials who lack reelection incentives are 23 pp more likely to abuse the unforeseen events clause than those who face reelection incentives. This abuse of law inflates contract prices by 23% and reduces value for money by 40%. These results are robust to various specification checks, including a Regression Discontinuity in Time (RDiT) design. We rule out the possibility that the documented effects are driven by better quality procurement due to the increased discretion. However, we find no evidence that electoral accountability deters more subtle malpractices, such as cost manipulation.
