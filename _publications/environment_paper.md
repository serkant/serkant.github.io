excerpt: '*R&R at New Perspectives on Turkey*


During the last decade, environmental issues have gained saliency in Turkish politics, especially after the Gezi Park demonstrations. However, no systemic empirical evidence exists to inform us about the relationship between politics and deforestation in Turkey. This paper brings together all possible drivers of deforestation–political, economic, and climatic factors–from Turkey and merges it with high-resolution satellite data on deforestation to do a systemic empirical analysis. The results show that districts with Justice and Development Party (AKP) mayors have higher deforestation by around a combined area of 42 football pitches on average in a given district. Similarly, increased mining activities and newly built dams positively correlate with deforestation.
