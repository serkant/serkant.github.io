    During the last decade, environmental issues have gained saliency in Turkish politics, especially after the 2013 Gezi Park demonstrations. This article is on the relationship between politics and deforestation in Turkey. It combines possible major drivers—political, economic, and climatic—of deforestation in Turkey with high-resolution satellite data on deforestation to conduct a systemic empirical analysis. The results show that districts in which Justice and Development Party mayors are in power have higher deforestation. The effect is around an average combined area of forty-two football fields in a given district. The article also shows that increased mining activities and newly built hydropower plants positively correlate with deforestation.

Do voters reward incumbents for the provision of public services? In this article, we study the political economy of catchment areas of public services to answer this question. Rather than examining the binary relationship between health care provision and electoral returns within politically defined borders, we study whether increases in geographic accessibility of health care providers and decreases in congestion in services attract votes for the incumbent. Leveraging a health care reform in Turkey, which substantially impacted the geospatial distribution of public health clinics in Istanbul, we find that decreases in walking time and improvements in congestion levels in the closest clinic from a polling station significantly increase vote share of the AKP, the incumbent party, at that polling station. We also show that poorer communities were more responsive to improvements in spatial accessibility to the local clinics.

   This paper examines whether electoral accountability deters public officials from abusing the law, using a novel indicator of law abuse that measures the unjustified use of the unforeseen events clause: an exception clause common in procurement regulations that grants officials with more discretion at times of force majeure events. By exploiting a natural experiment and applying a staggered Differences-in-Differences (DiD) design, we find that public officials who lack reelection incentives are 23 pp more likely to abuse the unforeseen events clause than those who face reelection incentives. This abuse of law inflates contract prices by 23% and reduces value for money by 40%. These results are robust to various specification checks, including a Regression Discontinuity in Time (RDiT) design. We rule out the possibility that the documented effects are driven by better quality procurement due to the increased discretion. However, we find no evidence that electoral accountability deters more subtle malpractices, such as cost manipulation.
